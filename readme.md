# ESP32 BLE Library based on Arduino

Quickly implement Bluetooth LE on ESP32 using the ESP-IDF FreeRTOS projects.

## Overview

The ESP32 BLE Library is based on the Arduino implementation so that you can quickly implement BLE on your FreeRTOS projects without having to use the Arduino library.

## References

The project is based on the works by NKolban's [ESP32_BLE_Arduino](https://github.com/nkolban/ESP32_BLE_Arduino) project. Project snippets can be found [here](https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets).
