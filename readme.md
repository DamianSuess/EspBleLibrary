# ESP32 BLE Library based on Arduino

Quickly implement Bluetooth LE on ESP32 using the ESP-IDF FreeRTOS projects.

## Overview

The ESP32 BLE Library is based on the Arduino implementation so that you can quickly implement BLE on your FreeRTOS projects without having to use the Arduino library.

## Coding Standards

Though this is still a "WiP", the library still needs to go through the Xeno Innovations coding standards and naming conventions.

Quick sample:

```cpp
// Parts of a class
class PascalCaseClass
{
  public:
    PascalCaseMethods();
    AnotherMethod(int camelCaseArgs);

  private:
    _privateFields;
}
```
